# Klipp
## Xcode templates for the rest of us.

Klipp is a command line gem for creating new (Xcode) projects from existing templates. Unlike Apple's private plist-based templating system, Klipp takes an existing Xcode project and creates a new project by copying and modifying an existing template project by your own specifications.

## Installation

Install Klipp with RubyGems:

    $ gem install klipp

Execute and read the usage instructions:

    $ klipp
